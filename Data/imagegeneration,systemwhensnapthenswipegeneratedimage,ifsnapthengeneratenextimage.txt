Hello Sushant Bhatt, I'd be happy to help you with your content writing needs!

Regarding your request for image generation when snapping and swiping, I would suggest the following approach:

1. First, you would need to develop an image recognition system that can detect when a user has taken a snap. This could be done using a combination of computer vision techniques, such as object detection and image classification.
2. Once the system has detected a snap, it can then generate the next image in the sequence. This could be done using a variety of methods, such as:
* Image blending: This involves overlapping two or more images to create a new image.
* Image morphing: This involves gradually transforming one image into another by interpolating between the two images.
* Image synthesis: This involves generating new images from scratch using machine learning algorithms, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs).
1. The generated image can then be displayed to the user, allowing them to swipe to the next image in the sequence.

Of course, the specific implementation details will depend on the exact requirements of your application. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss this in more detail, please let me know!
