Subject: Application for Fever Leave

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and have a high fever. I am unable to come to work today and request a leave of absence for the day. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better.

I will be monitoring my condition and will keep you updated if I need to take additional time off. In the meantime, I have made arrangements for my work to be covered by a colleague.

Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to returning to work as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Sushant Bhatt
[Your Position]
